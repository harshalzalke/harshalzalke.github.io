      Political risk and coordination failure are two leading causes of low investment and growth in low- and middle-income countries. 
      The international community devotes substantial resources to addressing these challenges. We show that these problems are 
      intertwined: political risk induces coordination failure. We then propose a subsidy program to eliminate politically induced miscoordination. 
      Our program---Guaranteed Return with Profit- and Loss-Sharing (GPLS)---offers a minimum return to investors while clawing back returns 
      above a specified maximum. The design screens out investors who would have invested even without subsidies and induces participation from 
      more hesitant investors at minimal cost. Optimally designed GPLS programs significantly reduce costs relative to natural alternatives, 
      such as guaranteed return schemes (e.g., fixed annual payments of $x$ per cent) or Guaranteed Return with Profit-Sharing (GPS) programs. 
      Such optimal subsidies represent a major step toward feasible and sustainable international interventions to coordinate development under political risk.

  - title: "Strategic Investments and War Prevention"

    abstract: > 
       To what extent does global economic exchange deter conflict between countries? This paper re-examines the pacifying effect of economic 
       ties by examining investment behavior in the presence of geopolitical risks. While investments can deter conflict by raising its opportunity cost, 
       the risk of war also affects firms' willingness to invest. The central finding is that deterrence depends not on the total volume of investment 
       but on how capital is distributed across firms. When capital is concentrated in a few large investors, an individual commitment can be pivotal 
       in tipping a government toward peace. By contrast, when the same amount of capital is dispersed across many smaller firms, individual contributions 
       have negligible influence on government decision. In both cases, firms must coordinate to deter conflict, but the coordination problem increases 
       greatly when capital is dispersed across many investors, limiting the pacifying effect of investments.

      Examines the rise of investment screening mechanisms and develops a
      contract-theoretic model of how governments design optimal screening to
      mitigate security risks while preserving investment.

      Uses a Blotto-style framework to analyze how a defender allocates resources
      between direct defense and intelligence gathering when facing multiple attackers,
      highlighting the strategic value of costly intelligence.
