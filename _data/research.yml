  - title: "Coordinating Development Under Political Risk (Job Market Paper)"
    authors: "with Mehdi Shadmehr"
    abstract: >
      Political risk and coordination failure are two leading causes of low investment.
      This paper shows how political risk induces miscoordination among investors and
      proposes an optimal subsidy program — Guaranteed Return with Profit- and Loss-Sharing (GPLS) —
      that restores efficiency at significantly lower cost than alternatives.
