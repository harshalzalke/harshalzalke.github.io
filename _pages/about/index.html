I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Department of Politics at Princeton</a>. I am also a fellow in the program for <a href="https://qaps.princeton.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Quantitative and Analytical Political Science</a>. My research interests broadly lie in Political Economy, Formal Theory, and International Relations. In particular, I study how political risks, including the risk of inter-state conflicts, affect investment decisions.</p> <p>You can find my CV <a href="assets/pdf/Harshal_CV.pdf">here</a>.</p> </body></html>
