Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Politics at Princeton](https://politics.princeton.edu/). I am also a fellow in the program for [Quantitative and Analytical Political Science](https://qaps.princeton.edu/). My research interests broadly lie in Political Economy, Formal Theory, and International Relations. In particular, I study how political risks, including the risk of inter-state conflicts, affect investment decisions. 

You can find my CV [here](assets/pdf/Harshal_CV.pdf).
